## Introduction

The personal work will consist in developing a workflow to run an experimental benchmark of differential analysis applied to thousands of features. 

The goal will be to acquire an empirical feeling of the impact of different parameters on the performances of differential analysis tests. 

To this purpose, we will work with artificial data produced by generating random numbers 

- following different distribiutions of probabilities (normal, Poisson), 
- with different differences between the population means
- with equal or distinct variances

We will then run different tests and compare their performances by measuring the power and false positive rates. 

## Questions

### 1. Impact of non-normality on Student test

Generate random numbers following either a normal or a Poisson distribution. 

### 2. Impact of heteroscedasticity

Generate random numbers following a normal distribution with either equal or unequal variances (test different values). Run Student and Welch test on both data types, and measure the sensitivity and power of the respective tests. 

### 3. Impact of sample size

Generate random numbers following a normal distribution, with equal variances, but with a series of different sample sizes. 

Run Student test and evaluate the impact of sample size on the rate of false positive and power of the test. 

### 4. Parametric versus non-parametric tests

Generate random numbers following a normal and some non-normal distribution of your choice (e.g. uniform). Run a parametric and a non-parametric test and compare the performances in terms fo power and false positive rate. 

### 5. 

### 6. 


Each student will develop an analysis to test one particular question.
